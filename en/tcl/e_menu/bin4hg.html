<h2 id="intro">What is this</h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>All of VCS including <em>Mercurial SCM</em> have a common problem with binary files of repository, namely:
<br>If the files were being changed, their versions (even mistaken or stale) are all present in VCS history - nearly 'as is', with minimal packing if any.
</p>
<p>
In the course of time, this accumulation of binaries would involve the terrific size of remote repository and its local clones. No wonder that you might hear about 60 Gb repositories - what if not the updateable binaries could fatten them?
</p>
<p>
At that, the value of the binary history is often minimal if not equal to zero.
</p>
<p>
So, at an opportunity the updateable binaries are excluded from the VCS history at all, by means of .gitignore, .hgignore etc.
</p>
<p>
But what can you do e.g. with <a href="https://bitbucket.org" title="https://bitbucket.org" rel="nofollow">bitbucket</a> sites (and analogues) that are built as usual <em>Mercurial SCM</em> repositories? Imagine you have a download page with links to binary files (.zip, .rar, .exe, .pdf etc.) and those files are disposed to update, often at that. To be downloaded or anyhow available, the binaries must be present in the site repository, i.e. in hg history.
</p>
<p>
It's a pity that <em>Mercurial SCM</em> doesn't provide the <em>'no history for a specific file'</em> facility. Hopefully, this would be fixed in future, but for now we need some workarounds.
</p>
<p>
A method proposed below allows to minimize the binary overheads for a <a href="https://bitbucket.org" title="https://bitbucket.org" rel="nofollow">bitbucket</a> site managed by <em>Mercurial SCM</em>.
</p>

<p>We'll consider the following case only:

<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li">there is a <a href="https://bitbucket.org" title="https://bitbucket.org" rel="nofollow">bitbucket</a> site managed by <em>Mercurial SCM</em></div></li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li">the site contains binary files not wanted in hg history</div></li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li">the site is developed by one person or a very small team</div></li>
</ul>

</p>
<p>
Pitifully, the <a href="https://bitbucket.org" title="https://bitbucket.org" rel="nofollow">bitbucket</a> announced <a href="https://bitbucket.org/blog/sunsetting-mercurial-support-in-bitbucket" title="https://bitbucket.org" rel="nofollow">Sunsetting Mercurial support in Bitbucket</a> which means "Mercurial features and repositories will be officially removed from Bitbucket and its API on June 1, 2020".
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless I hope the below considerations still apply to any of <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/MercurialHosting" title="Mercurial Hosting" rel="nofollow">other Mercurial hostings</a>.
</p>

</p>
The <a href="#code">code below</a> is for use in Linux, though being a bit remade it would fit to other platforms.
<p>

<p>
<br>

</p>

</div>

<h2 id="idea">Idea of this</h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>
First of all, let's subdivide the binary files into:

<ol>
<li><div class="li">any binaries that would not be updated</div></li>
<li><div class="li">little binaries that would be updated, though not often</div></li>
<li><div class="li">little binaries that would be often updated</div></li>
<li><div class="li">large binaries that would be updated</div></li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
1st and 2nd types are well suited to be included into hg history. We commit them once (twice or thrice as for 2nd type) and don't care about them anymore.
</p>
<p>
But the binaries of 3rd and 4th types should be somehow excluded from hg history.
</p>
<p>
At that, these binaries should be available in a site, both remote and local. On a local machine, these binaries must be at one of hg heads, as a localized version of <a href="http://tortoisehg.org" title="http://tortoisehg.org" rel="nofollow">TortoiseHg</a> shows:
</p>
<p>
<img src="files/bin4hg-1.png" class="media" alt="">
<br><span class=bg3>&nbsp;Figure 1&nbsp;</span>
</p>
<p>
A development is going on at the tip head where all commits are done, while the binary files are sort of outsiders: they are not on the tip head and stated as '?' (not managed) in 'hg status'. On the above picture, the binaries are in <b>BIN</b> revision.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://bitbucket.org" title="https://bitbucket.org" rel="nofollow">bitbucket.org</a> would not allow to push the multiple heads to a remote repository. To be exact, it would resist to the pushing of multiple heads as it's prone to confuse. 
</p>
<p>
Thus, we should delete this outside BIN revision before pushing the tip head. <b>We should strip BIN commit on <a href="https://bitbucket.org" title="https://bitbucket.org" rel="nofollow">bitbucket</a> repository as well!</b>
</p>
<p>
Then we should restore the 'bin' files as BIN revision <b>on the tip</b>. And to 'hg push' to a remote repository.
<br>So, the remote repository would contain our 'essential changes' and binaries. All of these would be seen in our <a href="https://bitbucket.org" title="https://bitbucket.org" rel="nofollow">bitbucket</a> site.
</p>
<p id=fig2>
At last, on a local machine we 'hg update' to a revision just prior to BIN. On the picture below, this situation is marked with <span class=bg2>&nbsp;It's not the tip revision! </span>:
</p>
<p>
<img src="files/bin4hg-2.png" class="media" alt="">
<br><span class=bg3>&nbsp;Figure 2&nbsp;</span>
</p>
<p>
No sooner than we commit new essential changes, the local repository would return to a state similar to <a href="#idea">the previous</a>:
</p>
<p>
<img src="files/bin4hg-3.png" class="media" alt="">
<br><span class=bg3>&nbsp;Figure 3&nbsp;</span>
</p>
<p>
Comparing Figure 1 and Figure 3, we see that the cycle repeats and there are no binary revisions between <b>#4</b> and <b>#8</b> except for the outside <b>BIN</b>.
</p>
<p>
The cost of this method is that you should push all of 'bin' directory to <a href="https://bitbucket.org" title="https://bitbucket.org" rel="nofollow">bitbucket</a> each time at pushing, even when there are no changes in 'bin' and the only change is a character in some page.html. What can you do with this? Push to your remote repository as rarely as possible. Push when the essential changes have been accumulated in your local repository.
</p>

<p>
<br>

</p>

</div>

<h2 id="how">How to do this</h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>
The preparatory steps:
<ul>
<li>The <a href="#idea">above idea</a> is implemented through the <a href="index.html" title="e_menu" rel="nofollow">e_menu</a> software. There are many options of <a href="index.html" title="e_menu" rel="nofollow">e_menu</a>, but for now all you need is just to <a href="index.html#introduction_2" title="e_menu" rel="nofollow"><b>install</b></a> and employ it in <a href="index.html#detailed_fm" title="e_menu" rel="nofollow">a file manager</a>.</li>
<br>
<li>The <em>.hgrc</em> file of your home directory should contain the lines:
<br>
<pre class="code">[ui]
username = MyName &lt;myname@mymail.mydomain&gt;

[extensions]
extdiff =
fetch =
strip =
</pre>
which enable <em>diff, fetch, strip</em> hg extensions. At that, the most important is the <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/StripExtension" title="Strip Extension" rel="nofollow"><b>strip</b></a>.
</li>
<br>
<li>The <em>.hgignore</em> file of your local repository should contain the lines:
<br>
<pre class="code">  syntax: regexp
  ^.+\.bak/.+
  ^\.hgignore</pre>
which exclude <em>.hgignore</em> file and <em>*.bak</em> directories (e.g. bin.bak) from the hg history.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
With this initialization done, let's start the working cycle described above.
</p>

<b>First of all</b> you must strip BIN commit on <a href="https://bitbucket.org" title="https://bitbucket.org" rel="nofollow">bitbucket</a> repository before 'hg push'! You cannot otherwise strip the remote commits.
<br>The remote stripping is performed through <span class=bg1>&nbsp;<a href="https://bitbucket.org" title="https://bitbucket.org" rel="nofollow">bitbucket</a>'s Repository&nbsp;</span> -&gt; <span class=bg1>&nbsp;Settings&nbsp;</span> -&gt; <span class=bg1>&nbsp;Strip commits&nbsp;</span>.
</p>

<p>
After that, run the <a href="index.html" title="index.html" rel="nofollow">e_menu</a> items:
<br><span class=bg1>&nbsp;Main menu&nbsp;</span> -&gt; <span class=bg1>&nbsp;Hg&nbsp;</span> -&gt; <span class=bg1>&nbsp;Next&nbsp;</span> -&gt; <span class=bg1>&nbsp;Push with BIN&nbsp;</span>
</p>

<p>
The 'Push with BIN' item brings up the warning message:
</p>
<p>
<img src="files/bin4hg-4.png" class="media" alt="">
<br><span class=bg3>&nbsp;Figure 4&nbsp;</span>
</p>
<p>
After selecting 'OK' you'll get two windows (a bit moved and resized for this figure):
</p>
<p>
<img src="files/bin4hg-5.png" class="media" alt="">
<br><span class=bg3>&nbsp;Figure 5&nbsp;</span>
</p>
<p>
The right window is a console showing a current state of repository. View it carefully and pay attention mostly to:
<ul>
<li><div class="li">?-files of bin directory; no other chages in 'HG STATUS'</div></li>
<li><div class="li">your essential commit being the tip in 'HG HEADS'</div></li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
It it's OK, close the window and enter the name of 'binary files' revision in the left dialog. 
</p>

<p>
The name of 'BIN' revision should correspond to the directory of binary files:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you select 'BIN' for the revision name, you should have 'bin' directory of binaries.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If 'BIN2' revision, then 'bin2' directory.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'BINARY' revision -&gt; 'binary' directory.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'DOWNLOAD' -&gt; 'download'.
<br>etc.
</p>
<p>
After entering the name of 'binary files' revision ('BIN' by default) and selecting 'OK' you would push the last commits + 'BIN' revision (as the tip commit) to <a href="https://bitbucket.org" title="https://bitbucket.org" rel="nofollow">bitbucket</a>. Your only action would be entering your <a href="https://bitbucket.org" title="https://bitbucket.org" rel="nofollow">bitbucket</a> password.
</p>
<p>
After entering the password and pushing, view the results and notice the position of last essential commit in hg history.
</p>
<p>
Most likely it is 3rd from the tip (just under 'BIN' revision). You should confirm it in the following dialog:
</p>
<p>
<img src="files/bin4hg-6.png" class="media" alt="">
<br><span class=bg3>&nbsp;Figure 6&nbsp;</span>
</p>
<p>
... and you would get the final messages:
</p>
<p>
<img src="files/bin4hg-7.png" class="media" alt="">
<br><span class=bg3>&nbsp;Figure 7&nbsp;</span>
</p>
<p>
Well done. Run <span class=bg1>&nbsp;Main menu&nbsp;</span> -&gt; <span class=bg1>&nbsp;Hg&nbsp;</span> -&gt; <span class=bg1>&nbsp;tortoisehg - thg&nbsp;</span> menu item to check if the state is like <a href="#fig2">on Figure 2</a>.
</p>

<p>
<br>

</p>

</div>

<h2 id="tips">Tips and traps</h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>
Probably, the only trouble you would come into while using this method is the forgotten stripping of BIN commit at <a href="https://bitbucket.org" title="https://bitbucket.org" rel="nofollow">bitbucket</a>.
</p>

<p>
A little trouble indeed.
</p>

<p>
To get over it, you should go to your <a href="https://bitbucket.org" title="https://bitbucket.org" rel="nofollow">bitbucket</a> repository and strip <b>all BIN commits</b> whatever they are.
<br>After that you should repeat 'Push with BIN' described in the previous section.
</p>

<p>
Let's look at this a bit closer. Suppose, we have <a href="https://bitbucket.org" title="https://bitbucket.org" rel="nofollow">bitbucket</a> repository where there is (unstripped) BIN commit:
</p>
<p>
<img src="files/bb1.png" class="media" alt="">
<br><span class=bg3>&nbsp;Figure 8&nbsp;</span>
</p>

<p>
Suppose, we've made a blunder with pushing another BIN commit to <a href="https://bitbucket.org" title="https://bitbucket.org" rel="nofollow">bitbucket</a> repository.
<br>We would see the following sad picture at <a href="https://bitbucket.org" title="https://bitbucket.org" rel="nofollow">bitbucket</a>:
</p>
<p>
<img src="files/bb2.png" class="media" alt="">
<br><span class=bg3>&nbsp;Figure 9&nbsp;</span>
</p>

<p id="fig10">
At <a href="https://bitbucket.org" title="https://bitbucket.org" rel="nofollow">bitbucket</a> we should perform  'Strip commit' all the same.
<br>We go through <span class=bg1>&nbsp;<a href="https://bitbucket.org" title="https://bitbucket.org" rel="nofollow">bitbucket</a>'s Repository&nbsp;</span> -&gt; <span class=bg1>&nbsp;Settings&nbsp;</span> -&gt; <span class=bg1>&nbsp;Strip commits&nbsp;</span> and enter <em>BIN</em> in 'Commit to strip' field:
</p>
<p>
<img src="files/bb3.png" class="media" alt="">
<br><span class=bg3>&nbsp;Figure 10&nbsp;</span>
</p>

<p>
Then we do 'Preview strip' and 'Confirm strip'.
</p>

<p>
We perform the stripping <b>twice</b> because there are two BIN commits at <a href="https://bitbucket.org" title="https://bitbucket.org" rel="nofollow">bitbucket</a> repository (in our test case).
<br>We have the following picture at the second stripping:
</p>
<p>
<img src="files/bb4.png" class="media" alt="">
<br><span class=bg3>&nbsp;Figure 11&nbsp;</span>
</p>

<p>
After the second stripping we have a correct commit history at <a href="https://bitbucket.org" title="https://bitbucket.org" rel="nofollow">bitbucket</a> repository:
</p>
<p>
<img src="files/bb5.png" class="media" alt="">
<br><span class=bg3>&nbsp;Figure 12&nbsp;</span>
</p>

<p>
...and after 'Push with BIN' we have the desired:
</p>
<p>
<img src="files/bb6.png" class="media" alt="">
<br><span class=bg3>&nbsp;Figure 13&nbsp;</span>
</p>

<p>
The following recommendations might be useful:
<ul>
<li>Go to your <a href="https://bitbucket.org" title="https://bitbucket.org" rel="nofollow">bitbucket</a> repository each time <u>before</u> and <u>after</u> pushing to it and check if it's OK.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>If you work in a team, send the appropriate messages to all of team members. See e.g. <a href="#fig10">Figure 10</a>. </li>
</ul><ul>
<li>If troubles occured during the pushing (disconnection, power cut etc.) and <em>bin</em> directory was gone, restore it from <em>bin.bak</em> directory.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>As <em>hg strip</em> is dangerous, back up your repository, at least its non-binary part. You may add the appropriate commands to the code below.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<br>

<h2 id="code">Menu code</h2>

<p>
You may change the <span class=bg1>&nbsp;Main menu&nbsp;</span> -&gt; <span class=bg1>&nbsp;Hg&nbsp;</span> -&gt; <span class=bg1>&nbsp;Next&nbsp;</span> -&gt; <span class=bg1>&nbsp;Push with BIN&nbsp;</span> menu item.
